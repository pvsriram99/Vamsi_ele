 <h3>LEDS</h3>
<center>

    <p>A LED display is a flat panel display that uses an array of light-emitting diodes as pixels for a video display.
        Their brightness allows them to be used outdoors where they are visible in the sun for store signs and billboards.
        In recent years, they have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles, as well as
        variable-message signs on highways. LED displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to
        visual display, as when used for stage lighting or other decorative (as opposed to informational) purposes.
        LED displays can offer higher contrast ratios than a projector and are thus an alternative to traditional projection
        screens, and they can be used for large, uninterrupted (without a visible grid arising from the bezels of individual
        displays) video walls.microLED displays are LED displays with smaller LEDs, which poses significant development challenges.</p>
<h3>Refridgerators</h3>
    <p>A refrigerator, colloquially fridge, is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).[1] A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that the refrigerator be kept at or below 4 °C (40 °F) and that the freezer be regulated at −18 °C (0 °F).[2]

The first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.</p>
<h3>Air-Conditioners</h3>
    <p>Air conditioning, often abbreviated as A/C or AC, is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior environment (sometimes referred to as 'comfort cooling') and in some cases also strictly controlling the humidity of internal air. Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or alternatively a variety of other methods, including passive cooling or ventilative cooling. Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Heat pumps are similar in many ways to air conditioners, but use a reversing valve to allow them to both heat and also cool an enclosed space.

Air conditioners, which typically use vapor-compression refrigeration, range in size from small units used within vehicles or single rooms to massive units that can cool large buildings.[1][2] Air source heat pumps, which can be used for heating as well as cooling, are becoming increasingly common in cooler climates.</p>
